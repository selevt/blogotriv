Blogotriv
=========

**NOTE: This project is not suitable for production. I wrote this to play
around with golang a bit.**

This is a very simple blog engine with support for posts and pages. The data
is read from a single JSON file and static pages.

Possible tasks when someone feels like fiddling around with the code:
* Allow C(R)UD of posts and pages
* Cache data and invalidate when applicable
* Different storage backends
